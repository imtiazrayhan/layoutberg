# WordPress Gutenberg Prompt Engineering Improvements

Looking at this prompt engineering class, here are the key areas that can be improved:

## 1. **Token Efficiency**

The current prompts are extremely verbose. The `get_core_instructions()` method alone is massive. You could reduce token usage by 60-70% while maintaining quality by:

-   Condensing rules into shorter, more direct instructions
-   Removing redundant examples
-   Using more concise language throughout
-   Only including block specifications that are actually needed for the specific request

## 2. **Dynamic Context-Aware Prompting**

Currently, the system dumps ALL possible instructions regardless of what's needed. Instead:

-   Analyze the user's request first to determine which blocks are actually needed
-   Only include relevant block specifications and examples
-   Adapt the prompt complexity based on the request complexity

## 3. **Better Prompt Structure**

The current structure mixes different concerns. Improve by:

-   Separating validation rules from generation instructions
-   Creating a clearer hierarchy: Critical Rules → Relevant Blocks → Style Guidelines → Minimal Examples
-   Using consistent formatting that's easier for the AI to parse

## 4. **Smarter Variation Handling**

The variation system is overly complex. Simplify by:

-   Using a seed-based approach for variations instead of arrays of options
-   Reducing the number of hardcoded variations
-   Making variations more contextual to the actual request

## 5. **Example Optimization**

Too many examples are provided upfront. Instead:

-   Include only 2-3 most relevant examples based on the request
-   Use inline examples within rules rather than a separate section
-   Keep examples minimal but complete

## 6. **Style Instructions**

The style instructions are too verbose and philosophical. Make them more actionable:

-   Convert descriptions into specific, measurable guidelines
-   Use bullet points for quick scanning
-   Focus on CSS classes and specific attributes rather than abstract concepts

## 7. **Error Recovery Strategy**

No clear strategy for handling generation failures. Add:

-   Validation-first approach to catch common errors
-   Specific correction prompts for common mistakes
-   Incremental generation for complex layouts

## 8. **Prompt Chaining for Complex Requests**

Instead of one massive prompt, consider:

-   Breaking complex layouts into stages (hero → content → footer)
-   Using the output of one stage to inform the next
-   Allowing for iterative refinement

## 9. **Template-Based Approach**

Rather than generating everything from scratch:

-   Create base templates for common patterns
-   Use prompts to customize templates rather than full generation
-   Reduce cognitive load on the AI model

## 10. **Remove Redundancy**

Several instructions are repeated multiple times:

-   Consolidate all validation rules in one place
-   Remove duplicate examples
-   Eliminate overlapping instructions between different methods

## Summary

These improvements would make the system more efficient, reliable, and easier to maintain while likely producing better results with lower token costs. The key principle should be: **only include what's necessary for the specific generation task at hand**.
