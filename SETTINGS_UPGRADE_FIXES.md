# Settings Page Upgrade Buttons and Messages - Fixes Applied

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed Missing Upgrade UI for Locked Tabs

**Problem**: The "Style Defaults" and "Agency Features" tabs were completely hidden from users who didn't have the required plans. This meant users couldn't discover these features.

**Solution**: 
- Made all tabs visible to all users
- Added lock icons to tabs that require higher plans
- Added CSS class `layoutberg-locked-tab` to restricted tabs
- Users can now click on locked tabs to see what features they're missing

### 2. Added Upgrade Messages for Locked Tabs

**Problem**: When users clicked on locked features, there was no clear upgrade path.

**Solution**: Added full-page upgrade messages that appear when users click on locked tabs:

#### Style Defaults Tab (Professional/Agency only)
```php
<div class="layoutberg-card">
    <div class="layoutberg-card-body layoutberg-text-center" style="padding: 60px 40px;">
        <span class="dashicons dashicons-lock" style="font-size: 48px; color: #9ca3af; margin-bottom: 20px; display: block;"></span>
        <h3>Style Defaults is a Professional Feature</h3>
        <p>Upgrade to Professional or Agency plan to customize default typography, colors, layout settings, and design styles for all your generated layouts.</p>
        [Upgrade to Professional button]
    </div>
</div>
```

#### Agency Features Tab (Agency only)
```php
<div class="layoutberg-card">
    <div class="layoutberg-card-body layoutberg-text-center" style="padding: 60px 40px;">
        <span class="dashicons dashicons-lock" style="font-size: 48px; color: #9ca3af; margin-bottom: 20px; display: block;"></span>
        <h3>Agency Features are Exclusive to Agency Plan</h3>
        <p>Upgrade to Agency plan to unlock prompt engineering templates, debug mode, verbose logging, and advanced multisite management features.</p>
        [Upgrade to Agency button]
    </div>
</div>
```

### 3. Enhanced Visual Styling

Added CSS to improve the visual presentation:
- Locked tabs have reduced opacity (0.8) but become fully opaque on hover
- Lock icons are properly aligned within tab navigation
- Upgrade CTA buttons have hover effects and proper styling
- Consistent spacing and layout for upgrade messages

### 4. Existing Upgrade Elements (Already Working)

The following elements already had proper upgrade buttons and messages:
- **Model Selection**: Shows locked models with "Professional plan required" text
- **Max Tokens**: Shows locked input with upgrade button for Starter users
- **Creativity Level**: Shows locked slider with upgrade button for Starter users

## Files Modified

1. `/admin/partials/layoutberg-admin-settings.php`:
   - Lines 104-121: Updated navigation to show all tabs with lock icons
   - Lines 731-1047: Added upgrade message for Style Defaults tab
   - Lines 1050-1280: Added upgrade message for Agency Features tab
   - Lines 1364-1403: Added CSS for locked tabs and upgrade CTAs
   - Lines 1370-1389: Updated JavaScript to handle locked tab clicks

## Testing

Created test script at `/test-settings-upgrade.php` to verify:
- License detection methods work correctly
- Upgrade button generation works
- All required CSS classes are present
- Settings page structure is correct

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Discoverability**: All features are now visible, encouraging upgrades
2. **Clear Messaging**: Users understand exactly what they'll get by upgrading
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Lock icons and reduced opacity clearly indicate restrictions
4. **Actionable CTAs**: Direct upgrade buttons make it easy to upgrade
5. **Consistent Design**: Matches the existing upgrade UI patterns in the plugin

## Fixes Applied for Upgrade Button Issues

### Problem
The upgrade buttons for Max Tokens and Creativity Level were not appearing in the settings page.

### Root Cause
The code was using a manual check (`is_professional_plan() || is_agency_plan()`) instead of the dedicated `can_use_advanced_options()` method that includes additional validation.

### Solution
Changed the licensing check from:
```php
$can_adjust_advanced = \DotCamp\LayoutBerg\LayoutBerg_Licensing::is_professional_plan() || 
                      \DotCamp\LayoutBerg\LayoutBerg_Licensing::is_agency_plan();
```

To:
```php
$can_adjust_advanced = \DotCamp\LayoutBerg\LayoutBerg_Licensing::can_use_advanced_options();
```

### Additional Improvements
1. Updated `get_action_url()` to point to dashboard pricing page
2. Added `layoutberg-pricing-trigger` class to upgrade buttons
3. Added pricing modal to admin_footer hook
4. Enhanced CSS styling for upgrade notices

## Next Steps

1. Test the settings page with different license levels
2. Verify upgrade buttons link to the correct URLs and open pricing modal
3. Ensure all text is properly internationalized
4. Consider adding tooltips to locked navigation items
