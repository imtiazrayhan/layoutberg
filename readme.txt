No! LayoutBerg is designed for everyone. Simply describe what you want in plain English, and the AI will handle the technical details.

LayoutBerg can generate layouts using all core WordPress blocks including paragraphs, headings, images, columns, groups, covers, buttons, lists, and more. Pro version will support third-party blocks.

= Is my API key secure? =

Yes, your API key is encrypted before being stored in the database and is never exposed in the frontend code.

= How much does it cost to use? =

LayoutBerg itself is free, but you'll need an OpenAI API key. OpenAI charges based on usage (typically $0.002 per generation with GPT-3.5 Turbo).

= Can I edit the generated layouts? =

Absolutely! The generated content is made of standard Gutenberg blocks that you can edit, rearrange, or customize just like any other blocks.

= Does it work with my theme? =

Yes! Since LayoutBerg generates native Gutenberg blocks, they'll inherit your theme's styling and work seamlessly with your site design.

= Can I save generated layouts as templates? =

Yes, you can save any generated layout as a reusable template in your library.

= What's the difference between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4? =

GPT-3.5 Turbo is faster and more affordable, perfect for most layouts. GPT-4 offers more advanced understanding and creativity for complex designs (Pro feature).
